This is a placeholder page for the IAC development standards. Some source material we can use if we want.

* [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/617)
* [Best practices module design](https://github.com/puppetlabs/best-practices/blob/master/puppet-module-design.md)
    * This repo is currently un-owned and may be archived soon. The SA team will own much of the best practices, but this, and other module design guides should be owned by IAC.
* [Puppet Style Guide](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/style_guide.html)
